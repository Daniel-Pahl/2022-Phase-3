# Back-end Phase 3

Welcome to Phase 3! For Phase 3, the requirement is to implement some more advanced features that are a bit more involved or difficult to get working.

## Back End Requirements

To pass phase 3 for the back-end, you will need to have any __five__ of the following advanced features, or any __two__ of the extra for experts features.

## Advanced Features List

* Implementation and support of GraphQL
* Usage of Terraform to structure and provision a cloud environment, which is incorporated into a CI/CD pipeline

## Example Repository

The following ack-end code is meant to be a reference, as to how you could implement some of these advanced features. This assignment is going to be tough, and we're sure you're going to have a lot of questions. Please ask them over on the discord server, where we will respond ASAP!
