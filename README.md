# 2022 Phase 3 :rocket:

Nearly there! Welcome to phase 3 to all of those that have passed phase 2. You've done very well so far, and you're nearly at the home stretch now. We're going to keep this brief, as I'm sure you're all tired of hearing the same old thing from us over and over again.

## The Brief

Now that you've gotten a bit more hands-on experience with code, we're going to throw you in the deep end (sorry, not sorry). In each section, we have set up a list of advanced features, with some requirements to pass. These will be explained in each section, each with their own requirements.

There are a total of __three__ sections - one for front-end, one for back-end, and one for data science. We __strongly__ recommend that you continue on with the sections that you picked for phase two, as the work here is __much__ harder if you decide to start from scratch. As always, you will only need to complete two out of the three sections.

## The Deadline

Phase 3 is due on the __11th of September__ at __11:59PM__.

## Submissions

Please submit your project repositories [here](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAN__lGr8gZUOTNTU1owR01COFFINjNKWlpSRVZHOTRVQS4u&fbclid=IwAR2Dy_NI8vsW3qXwf1Ysfn5pSMwQ1vR7sfPwstOng7sxStXkuNERhA7uzPQ) if you have uploaded a video to YT or any other video streaming platform,

Or [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckr2eNkUNJw2Fe_6rkixrNN1YAFSaCCnx1cEtPyR0HVHKiKQ/viewform) if you would like to upload it as a video file, or present in person.

## Additional Submission Piece

For phase 3, there will be an additional submission piece to what you would normally expect to submit - please record up to 5 minutes of presentation per section on your advanced features and showcase your project. Alternatively, if you are camera-shy (it's not just you, we swear) and would like some immediate feedback, please submit an availability window for either the 17th or the 18th to do a presentation!

We look forward to your submissions! GL;HF!
